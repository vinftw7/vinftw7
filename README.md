# Vincent

Previous experience: took some coding classes in Python and Java in the past... 

Why I took this course: to get better at coding and see if it interests me... 

I am interested in Tennis, card magic, movies, traveling... 

I want to improve at coding, and I want to create a wordle-type game.
